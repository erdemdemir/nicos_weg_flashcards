# DW Nico's Weg flashcards

## A2 flashcards

These flashcards are based on vocabulary of the series following the lesson structure. Each lesson is randomised in itself to prevent, at least to some extent, guessing the next card.

I used [Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/aistudio) to create examples and flashcards. I checked them as much as I can but of course there could be mistakes, hopefully not horrible ones.

### Source files

I worked on the following files in case you find it them useful:
- Initial [csv with duplicates](nicos_weg_flashcards_with_duplicates.csv) as some vocabulary can be found in more than one lesson.
- Same [csv after duplicates are removed](nicos_weg_flashcards_without_duplicates.csv).
- [Csv of flascards randomised within each lesson](nicos_weg_unique_rand_per_lesson.csv)
